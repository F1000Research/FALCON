FALCON
======
FALCON is a package designed to help compare different nestedness measures and null models in bipartite networks.


![FALCONs falcon](https://raw.github.com/sjbeckett/FALCON/master/Documentation/falcon.png)

It is currently implemented in the MATLAB language, but also functions in Octave.



## Features

FALCON currently allows computation of 3 nestedness measures for binary networks ([NODF](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16644.x), [Manhattan Distance](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2012.05.003), [spectral radius](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms2422)) and significance testing under 3 binary null models.

Additionally spectral radius and WNODF can be used for the analysis of weighted networks.
