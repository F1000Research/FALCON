 FALCON stands for Framework for Adaptive ensembLes for the Comparison Of
 Nestedness.
 This software is designed to allow users interested in the nestedness propertie
s of bipartite networks to compare the measures and statistical properties
 of some of the plethora of different nestedness measures and null models
 available in the literature using an adaptive sampling method.
 We aim to use this package to perform a comparison of these measures and
 null models using ecological datasets and question which measures do and
 do line up with each other.
 This document outlines and describes the methodology behind the functions
 used in the FALCON package.

 Their original concept was based on extending the ideas of Island Biogeography
 theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, such that as well as expecting that smaller islands that are further from
 mainland have lower species diversity and abundance due to immigration/emmigrat
ion processes that these islands contain a species composition that is a
 subset of the species compositions of islands closer to the mainland.
 In a perfect setting this would mean that the mainland would contain all
 the species found on any of the islands, such that the perfectly nested
 matrix contains an upper triangular pattern.
 This site-species bipartite network concept has been extended by others
 to cover many species-species bipartite networks, which are undergoing
 mutualistic or antagonistic interactions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and also species-time relationships and other types of networks and therefore
 the concept of nestedness should be regarded as a network structure in
 its own right, applicable to any type of bipartite network.

\begin_layout Section
Procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user inputs the matrix they wish to test for nestedness and several
 options that specify how they want to measure it.
 These are: which measurement method they wish to measure nestedness with,
 whether they are interested in binary or quantitative nestedness, which
 null model they wish to use in significance testing as well as which kind
 of solver they wish to use to perform the ensemble of null models.
 FALCON sorts the user input matrix into a nested configuration and removes
 any empty rows/columns before finding the nestedness of this matrix against
 the users choice.
 It determines whether a higher measure score is related to greater nestedness
 (or vice versa) in the chosen measure by comparing the measure taken from
 a highly nested network, a weighted upper triangular matrix(below left)
 using 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "staniczenko2013ghost"

\end_inset

's weighted nestedness definition against a highly un-nested weighted near
 checkerboard configuration(below right) in which the occupation and element
 sums are equal.
 This information is used to calculate the statistical significance of nestednes
s as a p-value in an ensemble which is assembled for each of the null models
 that the user wishes to test.
 Output is returned to the user in the form of the nested configuration
 of the input matrix, the measure of the input matrix, the expected value
 of nestedness under the null model (as the mean measure of matrices created
 in the ensemble), the number of ensemble members, the statistical significance
 of the nestedness of the input matrix against the null model as a p-value
 as well as the standard deviation and sample z-scores of the measure in
 the ensemble.

\begin_layout Section
Nested Configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For binary matrices the process of sorting matrices into a more nested configura
tion is relatively simple when (as we do here) we define nestedness in the
 same way as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "almeida2008consistent"

\end_inset

, such that the most nested configuration is that when rows and columns
 are assembled such that the next row/column is a subset of the preceeding
 one.
 Then the most nested configuration will be that such that the rows and
 columns are ordered in terms of their degree i.e.
 the number of connections between a node of one set and a node of the other
 set.
 Then rows and columns with a degree of zero are removed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ordering of rows and columns makes a difference to many, but not all
 of the measures (
\color black
spectral radius
\color inherit
) described below.
 We decide to sort input matrices (as well as the matrices produced by the
 null models) to this most nested ordering on the grounds that we are not
 investigating underlying features of the network, but rather the structure
 of nestedness itself, though understanding the processes involved in creating
 nested structures is important
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ulrich2012meanings"

\end_inset

.
 In many cases any underlying features may be unknown, or it may not be
 known how much they contribute to the nestedness structure.
 In practise, nestedness probably has more than one causal mechanism.
 However, some users may wish to test for the nestedness of a matrix in
 a set order rather than that of the nested configuration of their matrix.
 Enabling significance tests under this setup is work for furture versions
 of FALCON, however users can attain the raw measure score by running the
 required functions directly from the MEASURES folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steps to address the ordering of a quantitative matrix may need to be considered.
 There may be several ways of determining the best way to sort for the most
 nested quantitative matrix when there are two or more rows or columns with
 the same degree.
 Here we decide that if two rows have the same degree that it is the row
 which has more element values greater than the other - i.e.
 looking at the pairwise comparisons of non-zero column elements shared
 between the two rows, which row has the largest number of higher values.
 The same concept is applied to columns that share the same degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Solvers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fixed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of significance testing is performed using what we term a `fixed'
 solver.
 That is the number of null matrices used to make up the ensemble is determined
 by the user and is a fixed number.
 For the purposes of deciding whether a matrix is likely to be significantly
 nested or anti-nested at an arbitrary threshold (i.e.
 p<0.05 or p>0.95) this method is probably good enough providing that enough
 members are included in the ensemble to give it some statistical power.
 The larger the ensemble, the more power the test has and the closer the
 answer will be to the true p-value.
 In the literature among others 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "joppa2010nestedness"

\end_inset

 use 1,000 null models in their ensembles, whilst
\color black
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "McQuaid201353"

\end_inset


\color inherit
 use 10,000.
 However, there is no robust process in determining these numbers.
 It is up to the user to decide how well to sample from the underlying (and
 often unkown) distribution of the possible values of the null model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Adaptive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We approach this unsatisfying quality of the fixed solver, by introducing
 an adaptive approach.
 We illustrate one method here, but other adaptive methods and variations
 on what we present are possible.
 In our approach we take two sampling groups from the underlying distribution
 simultaneously.
 After the ensembles for each group have reached some initial minimum number
 of members (we use 250 in each group) we start to compare a summary statistic
 calculated from each of the two samples in an effort to question how alike
 the two sampling groups are.
 Once the summary statistic (here we use what we call the normalised temperature
 - defined as the nestedness measure of the input divided by the mean average
 nestedness measurement in the ensemble) from each group are within some
 threshold of each other we say the distribution is at least reasonably
 well sampled and then can combine the two group ensembles together before
 running statistics on them.
 The comparison steps are performed for every 25 new members to each group;
 and if the condition is not fulfilled when the maximum number of ensemble
 members is reached (10,000 in total here) then the members of each group
 are combined at this stage before running the statistics.
 In effect the adaptive solver is playing off between the degree of precision
 of the statistical properties found according to the threshold difference
 between the two groups and a large sample size.
 If the threshold limit is achieved then reliably good statistics (never
 perfect!) can be given (dependent on the threshold choice) without having
 to run so many null models.
 In the case that threshold limit is not achieved then the adaptive solver
 is doing just as well as the fixed solver with an ensemble size of 10,000.

NODF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nestedness measure based on overlap and decreasing fill(NODF) was first
 described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "almeida2008consistent"

\end_inset

 and has since become one of the most popular methods for describing the
 nestedness of a matrix.
 This is in part due to its ease of use, as it is deterministic and does
 not need to be statistically evaluated against an ensemble of null models
 and also to the transparency of its methods as its calculation is explicitly
 shown and is not subject to difficult calculations or algorithmic procedures.
 As we do not (and in general it isn't) know of any ecological gradient
 across our matrix, we use the form of NODF known as 
\begin_inset Formula $NODF_{MAX}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "podani2012comparative"

\end_inset

.
 We first find the degree of each row and column by finding the number of
 elements in each row/column with a value greater than zero.
 To achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $NODF_{MAX}$
\end_inset

 the matrix must be sorted by the degree of the rows and the columns such
 that the rows with highest degree are at the top of the matrix and the
 rows with lowest degree are at the bottom; and repeat with the columns
 such that the rows(columns) with largest degree have the lowest row(column)
 index.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $NODF_{COLUMNS}$
\end_inset

 can be found by pairwise evaluating columns.
 This works by taking the first column(highest degree) and comparing it
 to the second column.
 If both columns have same degree there cannot be overlap, so a zero score
 is assigned, else the score is the percentage of elements in the second
 column which also appear in the first column i.e.
 how much of a subset the second column is of the first.
 This process is repeated to compare the first column against all the other
 columns; then the second column is compared against the remaining columns,
 of which it should be a superset; and so on.
 The sum of all these scores is the column score, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{col}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $NODF_{COLUMNS}$
\end_inset

 is found by dividing 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{col}$
\end_inset

 by the number of comparisons, the number of columns (
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

) multiplied by the number of columns minus one(columns aren't assessed
 against themselves) all divided by two 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{c(c-1)}{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $NODF_{ROWS}$
\end_inset

 can be found in a similar manner.
 Putting these two measures together 
\begin_inset Formula $NODF_{MAX}$
\end_inset

 can be found as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
NODF_{MAX}=\frac{N_{col}+N_{row}}{\frac{(c(c-1)}{2}+\frac{(r(r-1))}{2}}=\frac{2(N_{col}+N_{row})}{c(c-1)+r(r-1)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Values for each of the NODF indexes is measured between 0, low nestedness
 and 100, perfect nestedness.

 which makes it appealing and it apparently behaves well against nestedness

 and
\color inherit
 then measuring the Manhattan distance 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of the network matrix.
 This is the sum of the row and column indexes of all of the matrix elements
 that are filled.
 Once

 is found, a null model is chosen (

cf.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) and an ensemble of matrices with similar properties to the studied matrix
 network are created and measured in a similar way.
 Each of these measurements is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{rand}$
\end_inset

.
 By finding the mean average 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{rand}$
\end_inset

, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $<D_{rand}>$
\end_inset

 from a large ensemble of null models 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tau}$
\end_inset

-Temperature can be calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{D}{<D_{rand}>}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is the nestedness of the network for which 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 was calculated against the expected nestedness of similar networks.
 As Manhattan distance is lower in more nested networks (due to being able
 to shuffle rows and columns to make many of the elements appear in the
 upper left where row and column indices are low and fewer elements appear
 in the lower right where row and column indices are greater), then 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau>1$
\end_inset

 implies 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $<D_{rand}>$
\end_inset

 and so the network is less nested than expected for a network with the
 properties defined in the null model.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tau}$
\end_inset

 can be described as a test statistic of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\tau}$
\end_inset

-Temperature method.
 We note it is also possible to calculate a p-value for nestedness from
 the

-Temperature by counting how many of the null models that make up the ensemble
 have a Manhattan distance less than that in our original network; i.e.
 are more nested than the network being studied, and divide this by the
 number of networks making up the ensemble.
 Then a low p-value(p
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow0$

) corresponds to the matrix network being significantly nested.

WNODF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weighted NODF measure, WNODF
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "almeida2011straightforward"

\end_inset

 is found using a similar algorithm for NODF, but is designed for use on
 quantitative rather than binary networks.
 In addition to asking which pairs of rows/columns are subsets of one another,
 by filled positions, for a row/column to be a weighted subset the preceding
 row/column must have greater values.
 As such, WNODF is essentially a stricter version of NODF and the highest
 score that could be achieved in WNODF is equal to that made under binary
 constraints in NODF.
 WNODF's assumptions consist in that a more nested matrix is one where the
 generalists have higher abundance than the specialists.
 Whilst this makes sense for species-site relationships in island biogeography
 theory, it makes less sense for antagonistic species-species relationships.
 Indeed it may well be expected that a tradeoff between generalism and specialis
m exists such that each specialist interaction should have a greater interaction
 than that of more generalist compatriots.
 Hence, we also look at WNODF in reverse such that the gradient is evaluated
 such that contributions to the WNODF-Reverse score only count if specialists
 have stronger interactions than that of generalists.
 We also investigated a mixture of WNODF row with WNODF-Reverse column scores
 and vice-versa.
 For example it may be expected that specialist phage (on generalist hosts)
 have high adsorption rates, whilst specialist hosts (with generalist phage)
 have low adsorption rates(WNODF rows, WNODF-Reverse columns).
 Both these mixed scores were higher than WNODF by the end of the simulation,
 but not as strong as that given by WNODF-Reverse.
 Indeed if we denote WNODF-Equal to only score when subsets have the same
 interaction strengths, NODF can be rewritten in terms of WNODF scores as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
NODF=WNODF+WNODF^{REVERSE}+WNODF^{EQUAL}

The spectral radius (

 algebra and dynamical systems theory which draws back on earlier ideas
 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who thought about defining nestedness to be a highly ordered state and
 were thinking in terms of ideas about entropy.

 than that of other matrix permutations in binary matrices and similarly
 that less nested structures have smaller

 They measure the significance of the nestedness of a particular matrix
 by evaluating the p-value, counting up the number of ensemble matrices
 built from null models that have a greater 
\begin_inset Formula $SR$

 than the original network.
 They also go on to show their approach is applicable to networks containing
 quantitative measures and that the SR approach measures quantitative nestedness
 in a similar way to WNODF, such that more nested matrices are those where
 the generalists have greater interaction strengths than specialists.

 It is the least strictly defined null model we consider here and is well

The fixed rows - fixed columns (FF) null model conserves size structure,

 The argument is that as such a degree-distribution is found in nature (the

 emerging.
 It is the most strict null model we consider here and is well known to
 suffer from type II errors

 (a failure to detect positives).
 Null models instantiations are found by searching the input matrix for
 2x2 submatrices and comparing them to the 2x2 identity matrix and its reflectio
n in one dimension (see below).
 If one of these configurations is found the corresponding rows and columns
 are swapped changing the submatrix into the other configuration shown.
 This is known as the Miklós-Podani row swap algorithm

 Thus it is somewhere between the EE and the FF null models.
 It is found by randomly removing elements from the input matrix which by
 doing so will not reduce the corresponding row or column degree to zero
 until a minimal core structure is attained.
 This ensures that the size structure is conserved.
 Then the removed elements are randomly reassigned into the remaining empty

 and conserves the entire binary structure of the input matrix and the values
 of the elements in the matrix, but shuffles the order of these values randomly.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
p-value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The p-value is the probability of a matrix composed under the rules of the
 null model being more nested than the input matrix.
 Thus a low p-value p
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 indicates that the chance of attaining a matrix (under the null model)
 that is more nested than the input is low, whilst a high p-value p
\begin_inset Formula $\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 indicates that the chance of attaining a more nested matrix is high.
 We can say that matrices that have p-values less than some threshold are
 statistically significantly nested at the threshold value, whilst matrices
 that get a p-value above some threshold are statistically significantly
 anti-nested at that threshold.
 It is calculated by counting the number of null model matrices that return
 a score more nested than that of the input matrix and dividing this by
 the number of null model matrix members in the ensemble.
 In the cases where the p-value is found to be p
\begin_inset Formula $=0$
\end_inset

 we conservatively assign it the value of 1 out of the total ensemble size.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Normalised Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normalised temperature is taken from ideas of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

-Temperature and describes the relationship between nestedness measure found
 for the input matrix and the expected nestedness measure found from the
 null model ensemble.
 It is described as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N=\frac{Measure}{<Measure>}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In measures where increasing nestedness is found with increasing measure
 score e.g.
 NODF, if the normalised temperature is found to be greater than 1 it indicates
 that the input matrix is more nested than expected, whilst if the normalised
 temperature is found to be less than 1 the input matrix is less nested
 than expected.
 Conversely in measures where increasing nestedness is found with decreasing
 measure score e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

-Temperature, the opposite is true such that a normalised temperature (the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

-Temperature in this particular case) greater than 1 indicates the input
 matrix is less nested than expected, whilst a normalised temperature less
 than 1 indicates the input matrix is more nested than expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Adjusted Normalised Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compare this measure across different nestedness measurements
 we choose to create the adjusted normalised temperature, which is equivalent
 to the normalised temperature if nestedness increases with increasing measure
 score, but otherwise is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N'=\frac{1}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the adjusted normalised temperature score always describes the tendancy
 of nestedness of the input matrix measure in the same direction, such that
 
\begin_inset Formula $N'$
\end_inset

 scores greater than 1 indicate that the matrix is more nested than would
 be expected under the rules of the null model, whilst a score less than
 1 indicates it is less nested than would be expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Mean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean average of the set of nestedness measure found for each of the
 ensemble members is returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Standard Deviation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard deviation (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) of the set of nestedness measures found for each of the ensemble members
 is returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Sample z-score
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The z-score, or standard score, is calculated as the difference between
 the nestedness measure and its expected value divided by the standard deviation
 of the sample: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z=\frac{Measure-<Measure>}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a measure of the number of standard deviations the nestedness measure
 of the input matrix is above the expected value.
 Hence, the way it should be interpreted, as with the normalised temperature,
 depends on whether nestedness increases with increasing measure score.
